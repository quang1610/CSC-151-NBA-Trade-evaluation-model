By: James Lim, Quang D Nguyen, Neel Lal

Our project goals were to determine whether a trade between two players is beneficial for an inputted team. We used the team-record of a team after the trade as a measure for how beneficial the trade is for the team

What our algorithm can do:
- Our algorithm can predict the team-records for the next season to see how the teams will perform with their current .
- From the input database, we come up with a decent ranking algorithm that gives a fairly accurate assessment of teams’ performance in the 2017-2018 season and applicable to predict teams’ performance in the 2018-2019 season.
- We also come up with an algorithm to simulate trading. We can input 2 players and the algorithm will output their teams’ stat before and after the trade (using “trade” procedure), and we can see how their ranking points go up or down (using “calculate-rank-trade”). We can use this information to see if the trade is beneficial.
